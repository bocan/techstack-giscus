# techstack-giscus

This github repo holds the comments for my [home page / blog](https://chris.funderburg.me/) within Github Discussions via [Giscus](https://giscus.app/).

It's a pretty neat tool compared to some of the other commenting systems out there.  On one side, it's a bit unfortunate that only Github users can comment as that means only a certain kind of techy can use it.  But that said, you're never gonna get comment spam - which is golden! 😁
